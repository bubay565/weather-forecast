# weather-forecast
A weather forecast Single Page App (SPA) for London, UK.

This application displays the weather information for London, UK in 3 hourly intervals for the next five days. Weather information is retrieved from the Open Weather Map API.

This project has been completed using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. You only need a
modern web browser (compatible browsers listed below) to view this app.

Simply clone/download the source files, navigate to the directory and launch index.html using a compatible web browser with an active internet connection.

If time weren't a constrain, I'd
1). Write unit tests.
2). Figure out a way to present users with a daily weather summary and then display the 3 hourly breakdown as and when requested by the user.
3). Implement a search so users can obtain the weather forecast for any location of their choice.
4). Implement a better UI.
