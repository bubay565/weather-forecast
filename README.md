# weather-forecast
A weather forecast Single Page App (SPA) for London, UK.

This application displays the weather information for London, UK in 3 hourly intervals for the next five days. Weather information is retrieved from the Open Weather Map API.

This project has been completed using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. You only need a
modern web browser (compatible browsers listed below) to view this app.

Simply clone/download the source files, navigate to the directory and launch index.html using a compatible web browser with an active internet connection.

I have also hosted this application on Githb pages so you can view this application at the following url: https://bubay565.github.io/weather-forecast/

If time weren't a constrain, I'd
1). Write unit tests.
2). Figure out a way to present users with a daily weather summary and then display the 3 hourly breakdown as and when requested by the user.
3). Implement a search so users can obtain the weather forecast for any location of their choice.
4). Implement a better UI.
5). As the day progresses, data returned from the open weather map API changes, therefore I'd implement a check to ensure data displayed for any particular day is specifically for that day and doesn't overlap into the next day as presently occurs.
